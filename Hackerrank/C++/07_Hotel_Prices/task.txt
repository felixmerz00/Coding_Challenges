In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

The given code defines two classes HotelRoom and HotelApartment denoting respectively a standard hotel room and a hotel apartment. An instance of any of these classes has 
two parameters: bedrooms and bathrooms denoting respectively the number of bedrooms and the number of bathrooms in the room.

The prices of a standard hotel room and hotel apartment are given as:

Hotel Room: 50 * bedrooms + 100 * bathrooms.
Hotel Apartment: The price of a standard room with the same number bedrooms and bathrooms plus 100.

For example, if a standard room costs 200, then an apartment with the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms costs 300.

In hotel's codebase, there is a piece of code reading the list of rooms booked for today and calculates the total profit for the hotel. However, sometimes calculated profits 
are lower than they should be.

Debug the existing HotelRoom and HotelApartment classes' implementations so that the existing code computing the total profit returns a correct profit.
